        Colout is Color text streams with this simple commandinja 2 and good
        intentions. And before you ask: It's BSD licensed!
        
        SYNOPSIS
        ````````````
        
        ``colout`` [-h][-e] [-g][-t] [-s][-l] PATTERN [COLOR(S)][STYLE(S)]
        
        DESCRIPTION
        `````````````````
        
        ``colout`` read lines of text stream on the standard input and output
        characters matching a given regular expression *PATTERN* in given and
        *STYLE*.

        If groups are specified in the regular expression pattern, only them are
        taken into account, else the whole matching pattern is colored.

        You can specify severall colors or styles when using groups by
        separating them with commas. If you indicate more colors than groups,
        the last ones will be ignored. If you ask for less colors, the last one
        will be duplicated across remaining groups.

        Available colors are: blue, black, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, white,
        red, rainbow, random, Random, scale, none or any number between 0 and
        255.

        Available styles are: normal, bold, faint, italic, underline, blink,
        rapid\_blink, reverse, conceal or random.

        ``Random`` will color each matching pattern with a random color among
        the 255 available in the ANSI table. ``random`` will do the same in 8
        colors mode.
        
        rainbow\` will cycle over a 8 colors rainbow at each matching pattern.

        ``scale`` will parse the matching text as a decimal number and apply the
        rainbow colormap according to its position on a scale defined by the
        ``-l`` option (see below, [0-100] by default).

        When not specified, a *COLOR* defaults to *red* and a *STYLE* defaults
        to *bold*.

        ``colout`` comes with some predefined themes to rapidely color
        well-known outputs (see the ``-t`` switch below).

        If the python-pygments library is available, ``colout`` can be used as
        an interface to it (see also the ``-s`` switch below).

        ``colout`` is released under the GNU Public License v3.

        OPTIONS
        ```````

        -  ``-h``, ``--help``: Show an help message and exit

        -  ``-g``, ``--groups``: For color maps (like "rainbow"), iterate over
           matching groups in the pattern instead of over patterns.

        -  ``-c``, ``--colormap``: Use the given list of comma-separated colors
           as a colormap (cycle the colors at each match).

        -  ``-l``, ``--scale``: When using the 'scale' colormap, parse matches
           as decimal numbers (taking your locale into account) and apply the
           rainbow colormap linearly between the given SCALE=min,max
           (SCALE=0,100, by default).

        -  ``-a``, ``--all``: Color the whole input at once instead of line per
           line (really useful for coloring a source code file with strings on
           multiple lines).

        -  ``-t``, ``--theme``: Interpret PATTERN as a predefined theme (perm,
           cmake, g++, etc.)

        -  ``-s``, ``--source``: Interpret PATTERN as a source code readable by
           the Pygments library. If the first letter of PATTERN is upper case,
           use the 256 colors mode, if it is lower case, use the 8 colors mode.
           In 256 colors, interpret COLOR as a Pygments style (e.g. "default").


        REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
        ```````````````````

        A regular expression (or *regex*) is a pattern that describes a set of
        strings that matches it.

        ``colout`` understands regex as specifed in the *re* python module.
        Given that ``colout`` is generally called by the command line, you may
        have to escape special characters that would be recognize by your shell.

        DEPENDENCIES
        ````````````

        Recommended packages :

        -  ``argparse`` for a usable arguments parsing
        -  ``pygments`` for the source code syntax coloring
        -  ``babel`` for a locale-aware number parsing

        EXAMPLES
        ````````

        -  Color in bold red every occurence of the word *color* in colout
           sources: ``cat colout.py | colout color red bold``

        -  Color in bold violet home directories in */etc/passwd*:
           ``colout '/home/[a-z]+' 135 < /etc/passwd``

        -  Use a different color for each line of the auth log
           ``grep user /var/log/auth.log | colout "^.*$" rainbow``

        -  Color in yellow user/groups id, in bold green name and in bold red
           home directories in */etc/passwd*:
           ``colout ':x:([0-9]+:[0-9]+):([^:]+).*(/home/[a-z]+)' yellow,green,red normal,bold < /etc/passwd``

        -  Color in yellow file permissions with read rights for everyone:
           ``ls -l | colout '.(r.-){3}' yellow normal``

        -  Color in green read permission, in bold red write and execution ones:
           ``ls -l | colout '(r)(w*)(x*)' green,red normal,bold``

        -  Color permissions with a predefined template:
           ``ls -l | colout -t perm``

        -  Color in green comments in colout sources:
           ``colout '.*(#.*)$' green normal < colout.py``

        -  Color permissions with a predefined template:
           ``ls -l | colout -t perm``

        -  Color in green comments in colout sources:
           ``colout '.*(#.*)$' green normal < colout.py``

        -  Color in light green comments in non-empty colout sources, with the
           sharp in bold green:
           ``grep -v '^\s*$' colout.py | colout '.*(#)(.*)$' green,119 bold,normal``

        -  Color in bold green every numbers and in bold red the words *error*
           in make output:
           ``make 2>&1 | colout '[0-9]+' green normal | colout error``

        -  Color a make output, line numbers in yellow, errors in bold red,
           warning in magenta, pragma in green and C++ file base names in cyan:
           ``make 2>&1 | colout ':([0-9]+):[0-9]*' yellow normal | colout error | colout warning magenta | colout pragma green normal | colout '/(\w+)*\.(h|cpp)' cyan normal``
           Or using themes: ``make 2>&³ | colout -t cmake | colout -t g++``
        -  Color each word in the head of auth.log with a rainbow color map,
           starting a new colormap at each new line (the begining of the command
           is just bash magic to repeat the string "(\\w+)\\W+":
           ``L=$(seq 10) ; P=${L//??/(\\w+)\\W+} ; head /var/log/auth.log | colout -g "^${P}(.*)$" rainbow``

        -  Color each line of a file with a different color among a 256 color
           gradient from cyan to green:
           ``head /var/log/auth.log | colout -c "^.*$" 39,38,37,36,35,34``

        -  Color a source code in 8 colors mode, without seeing comments:
           ``cat colout.py | grep -v "#" | colout -s python``

        -  Color a source code in 256 colors mode:
           ``cat colout.py | colout -s Python monokai``

        -  Color a JSON stream:
           ``echo '{"foo": "lorem", "bar":"ipsum"}' | python -mjson.tool | colout -t json``

        -  Color a source code substring:
           ``echo "There is an error in 'static void Functor::operator()( EOT& indiv ) { return indiv; }' you should fix it" | colout "'(.*)'" Cpp monokai``
